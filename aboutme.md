title: About me
---

Hi there! My name is Sarah, I'm 24 years old and I'm currently living in Brazil.

I have a degree on Information Management and during university I was able to discover my passion for innovation, technology and data, so that today I work as a Data Engineer!

I'm passionate about yoga, books and writing, and on my free time you'll probably find me reading something, listening to music or watching series.
